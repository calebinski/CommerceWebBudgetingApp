First you will need to have a version of SQL Server installed
Then you will need to adjust your connectionString, it is placed in the Web.config file

If you can connect to the database from Visual Studio, find your database and right-click to
	add a table, then insert the table creation sql (located in an accompanying file)
	statements one at a time and run them.

Once the tables are made, create a user and a category, there are commands in the Data Abstraction
layer that can do that.
